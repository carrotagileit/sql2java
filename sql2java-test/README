# Test of sqlfile and sql2java plugins

Use this as a model for how to use the plugin in your environment. E.g.
- Put your SQL in src/main/sql/NN-blah.sql
- Use sqlfile plugin in build->plugins to source it into a temporary hsqldb
- Use sql2java plugin in build->plugins to generate managers and beans to generated source dir
- Test, etc.

Currently known problem:

    [WARNING] Some problems were encountered while building the effective model for net.sourceforge:sql2java-test:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT
    [WARNING] 'build.plugins.plugin.(groupId:artifactId)' must be unique but found duplicate declaration of plugin net.sourceforge:sql2java-maven-plugin @ net.sourceforge:sql2java-test:[unknown-version], /Users/xgp/projects/sql2java/github/sql2java-test/pom.xml, line 74, column 15
    [WARNING]
    [WARNING] It is highly recommended to fix these problems because they threaten the stability of your build.
    [WARNING]
    [WARNING] For this reason, future Maven versions might no longer support building such malformed projects.

This is because, for some reason, my plugin mojos aren't picking up all the properties when they are specified in separate <execution>s of the same plugin. Will fix later.
